h1. Introduction

This is a small utility intended to create backups of server config files with
ease but it allows to backup any files.

When you manage several servers or other remote machines and want to have all
the config files in a safe place, versioned with git, this might be for you.

It works with minimal requirements. Basically you need an sshd running on your
remote machines and you need git and scp locally.

h2. Instructions

Copy the hosts.yml.example to your desired backup directory/hosts.yml and modify
it to suit you servers.

Currently it works best with public key authentication. If you don't want to
enter your passphrase on every host I recommend using a ssh-agent for that
or to use special backup keys without a passphrase.

Run:

<pre><code>sudo ruby backup.rb /absolute/path/to/backup/dir</code></pre>

Sudo is needed because the transferred files most likely have permissions
and guids other than the user you are running this script with.
